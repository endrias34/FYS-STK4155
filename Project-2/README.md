# FYS-STK4155 project 2 
In this project, we investigate regression and classification problems. We use the Franke function and the MNIST as data sets. To solve the regression problem, we use a fully connected neural network (NN) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)-based Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Ridge regression methods. The classification problem is solved using NNs and multinominal logistic regression.

All the analysis presented in our report can be reproduced by using our python codes and the corresponding Jupyther notebook.

## Folder structure
